👋 Hello! I'm a data enthusiast with a background in Applied Mathematics and a passion for public policy and data-driven insights.

🌐 I've worked on several projects for organizations that focus on public funds and policy, where I’ve analyzed and visualized data to support informed decision-making. My experience includes gathering, processing, and interpreting data, especially related to public sector wages, educational funding, and resource allocation.

📊 I'm working toward a career as a data scientist, leveraging my analytical skills and mathematical expertise to solve complex problems and uncover meaningful insights. I’m particularly interested in using data to drive transparency and efficiency in public sector decision-making.

💡 Tech Skills:

- Data Collection: Web scraping, API integration
- Data Analysis & Modeling: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy), Jupyter Notebook
- Data Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning: Gradient descent, regression analysis
📈 My GitHub is a place for my projects and experiments in data science. I'm constantly learning and exploring new methods to refine my skills. Let’s connect if you share an interest in public policy, data science, or if you have interesting data projects to collaborate on!
